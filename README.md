# Gizmo

Well, this is just a little something I built for a DAO I'm privileged to be a member of, to help with trading NFTs. Nothing fancy here tbh, wish I could do more but I couldn't break through

Basic Functionalities
- Check floor prices on Magic eden, Open sea and Coral cube
- Check sell wall (basically, how many NFTs need to be bought to get to a particular floor price). s/o to $NJLL
- Dictionary command (added because $NJLL always emphasized on us (the DAO) not being bozos kek)

Probably one or two easter eggs in there
